**Exercise:** Majors Survey Fall 2024 Data Exploration and Cleaning  

### Purpose  
The purpose of this notebook is to explore, clean, and prepare the "MajorsFall24" dataset f
or analysis.  
This includes inspecting its structure, identifying data integrity issues such as missing 
values 
or redundant features, and performing cleaning operations to make the dataset consistent, 
readable, and analysis-ready.  
By completing this process, I ensure that any insights drawn later are based on accurate 
and reliable data.

### Notebook Outline
1. Load and preview the data  
2. Explore with `pandas` built-in functions 
(`describe`, `columns`, `shape`, `dtypes`, `head`, `tail`, `sample`, `info`)  
3. Identify and evaluate data integrity issues  
4. Clean the data (rename columns, condense categories, remove irrelevant fields)  
5. Save the cleaned dataset  

## Project 1 - Part 3: Data Analysis

**Course:** Data Science Programming  

### Purpose  
This notebook analyzes the cleaned "MajorsFall24" dataset to uncover trends related to demographics, influences, and outreach for computing programs at County College of Morris (CCM).  
The findings will help guide the CCM IT Department's recruiting and communication strategies.

### Research Questions  
1. What is the demographic makeup of computing majors at CCM?  
2. What is the age distribution among computing majors?  
3. Which computing degree programs have the highest enrollment at CCM?  
4. How do demographic factors (gender and age) vary across the top computing degree programs?
