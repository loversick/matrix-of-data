**Exercise:** Majors Survey Fall 2024 Data Exploration and Cleaning  

### Purpose  
The purpose of this notebook is to explore, clean, and prepare the "MajorsFall24" dataset f
or analysis.  
This includes inspecting its structure, identifying data integrity issues such as missing 
values 
or redundant features, and performing cleaning operations to make the dataset consistent, 
readable, and analysis-ready.  
By completing this process, I ensure that any insights drawn later are based on accurate 
and reliable data.

### Notebook Outline
1. Load and preview the data  
2. Explore with `pandas` built-in functions 
(`describe`, `columns`, `shape`, `dtypes`, `head`, `tail`, `sample`, `info`)  
3. Identify and evaluate data integrity issues  
4. Clean the data (rename columns, condense categories, remove irrelevant fields)  
5. Save the cleaned dataset
